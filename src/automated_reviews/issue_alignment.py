"""Advisory alignment check for issues filed against this repository.

An issue becomes a specification the moment an implementing agent reads it, and the
proposals worth catching are well-formed: they carry symptom, evidence, and impact, and
they hand the consuming repository a switch inside a "Suggested direction" section. No
schema check reaches that, so this runs a model against CONTRIBUTING.md and the QC
authority policies and asks the one question those documents turn on.

The verdict is advisory and deliberately asymmetric in what it can express. A clean run
has no side effects at all — no label, no comment, nothing to cite. Only a suspected
inversion speaks. That keeps the check from becoming a clearance surface: absence of a
comment is not approval, because absence is also what a clean run looks like.
