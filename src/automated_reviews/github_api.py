"""Typed parsing for the GitHub API response shapes ai-review-ci reads.

Centralizes the code-scanning alert and review-thread shapes that ``context.py``
renders, replacing scattered key-by-key extraction (``_string`` / ``_integer`` /
``_mapping`` and the per-field ``_alert_*`` helpers) with one validated boundary.
``extra="ignore"`` lets GitHub return its many other fields without failing.

The constraints here mirror the previous hand-rolled validators exactly:
non-empty ``rule.id`` / ``location.path`` / ``html_url`` / comment ``body``,
strict integer ``start_line``, strict boolean ``isResolved``, and — for review
threads — a ``path`` that is required only once the thread actually has a
comment (an empty-comment thread is dropped before its path is read).

Scope note: only the fields the renderer consumes are modeled. The SARIF
carry-forward payload still forwards the *raw* alert dict verbatim
(``context._carry_forward_payload``), so no unmodeled field is dropped.
