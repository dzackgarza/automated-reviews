# Deepening Vocabulary

Shared vocabulary for architectural deepening analysis.
Use these terms exactly in every suggestion.
Consistent language is the point — don't drift into "component," "service," "API," or "boundary."

This vocabulary is the constructive counterpart to the slop patterns in [`code-patterns.md`](code-patterns.md) and [`simplification.md`](simplification.md).
Where those references detect *shallowness*, this vocabulary names the *deepening* that replaces it.

## Terms

**Module** Anything with an interface and an implementation.
Deliberately scale-agnostic — applies equally to a function, class, package, or tier-spanning slice.
*Avoid*: unit, component, service.

**Interface** Everything a caller must know to use the module correctly.
Includes the type signature, but also invariants, ordering constraints, error modes, required configuration, and performance characteristics.
*Avoid*: API, signature (too narrow — those refer only to the type-level surface).

**Implementation** What's inside a module — its body of code.
Distinct from **Adapter**: a thing can be a small adapter with a large implementation (a Postgres repository) or a large adapter with a small implementation (an in-memory fake).
Reach for "adapter" when the seam is the topic; "implementation" otherwise.

**Depth** Leverage at the interface — the amount of behaviour a caller (or test) can exercise per unit of interface they have to learn.
A module is **deep** when a large amount of behaviour sits behind a small interface.
A module is **shallow** when the interface is nearly as complex as the implementation.

**Seam** *(from Michael Feathers)* A place where you can alter behaviour without editing in that place.
The *location* at which a module's interface lives.
Choosing where to put the seam is its own design decision, distinct from what goes behind it.
*Avoid*: boundary (overloaded with DDD's bounded context).

**Adapter** A concrete thing that satisfies an interface at a seam.
Describes *role* (what slot it fills), not substance (what's inside).

**Leverage** What callers get from depth.
More capability per unit of interface they have to learn.
One implementation pays back across N call sites and M tests.

**Locality** What maintainers get from depth.
Change, bugs, knowledge, and verification concentrate at one place rather than spreading across callers.
Fix once, fixed everywhere.

## Principles

- **Depth is a property of the interface, not the implementation.** A deep module can be internally composed of small, mockable, swappable parts — they just aren't part of the interface.
  A module can have **internal seams** (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the **external seam** at its interface.

- **The deletion test.** Imagine deleting the module.
  If complexity vanishes, the module wasn't hiding anything (it was a pass-through).
  If complexity reappears across N callers, the module was earning its keep.

- **The interface is the test surface.** Callers and tests cross the same seam.
  If you want to test *past* the interface, the module is probably the wrong shape.

- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam.
  Two adapters means a real one.** Don't introduce a seam unless something actually varies across it.

## Cross-References

- **anti-slop** → Uses this vocabulary to name what's shallow and what deepening would replace it with.

- **thermo-nuclear-code-quality-review** → Uses this vocabulary when identifying pass-through wrappers and missed deepening opportunities.

- **code-patterns/references/classes.md** → Overlaps on DIP and cohesion; deepening vocabulary adds the *leverage* and *locality* dimensions.
