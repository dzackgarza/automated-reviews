# QC Triage Protocol

This document defines the mandatory triage procedure when `test-ci` or `ambient` emits `QC FAILURE — TRIAGE REQUIRED`. It is a reference for the `reviewing-llm-code` skill and for the directive emitted by central QC.

It does not apply to `test-commit` or `test-push`. Those gates emit `DIRECT REPAIR REQUIRED`: the current agent fixes the reported compiler, formatter, type, build, or test error directly.
Local type/test failures do not enter the returned-PR-feedback triage workflow.

## Role Boundary

The agent that hits a policy-sensitive CI or ambient finding is the orchestrator for that finding.
It may route the failure, but it may not judge it or remediate it.
Triage exists because the agent that produced or touched the failing work is biased toward preserving that work.

The ban on reading `~/ai-review-ci/` is role-specific:

- During downstream QC triage, the orchestrator must not inspect `~/ai-review-ci/`, the QC configs, tool scripts, models, prompts, or remediation policy.
  Those are the surfaces it could use to game the gate.

- During explicit maintenance of `ai-review-ci` itself, inspecting `~/ai-review-ci/` is required.
  In that task, `ai-review-ci` is the source repository, not the forbidden downstream-triage target.

Do not collapse these two cases.
A downstream remediation run and a central-QC guidance edit have different ownership boundaries.

## Immediate Orchestrator Rules

When the triage directive is emitted, the orchestrator MUST:

1. **Make no judgment calls about findings.** Do not decide, state, hint, imply, or act on whether a finding is real, false, clean, slop, a false positive, or a tool bug.

2. **Pivot into triage; do not freeze everything.** Pause only the work that produced or depends on the failing change, and redirect your own effort into the triage/remediation flow until the gate is resolved.
   This is a pivot, not a global halt: unrelated running work, background jobs, and other agents' tasks continue.
   Do not advance the failing change itself (push it, build on it, or report it complete) until triage resolves.

3. **Do not probe QC internals.** Do not read, inspect, or modify `~/ai-review-ci/` during downstream triage.
   Do not read the remediation policy yourself.
   The remediation subagent reads it when that role starts.

4. **Do not self-fix and do not self-evaluate.** Review/disposition and remediation are delegated to agents that were not involved in producing the failing code.

5. **Present the raw output.** Show the complete raw QC output to the user.
   Do not filter, summarize, group, reinterpret, or convert it into your own report.

6. **Route under existing authority.** A gate failure during active user-authorized work does not require renewed approval.
   Ask the user only for a policy exception, out-of-scope remediation, irreversible or externally visible action, or another genuine authority boundary.

## Routing Gate Within Existing Authority

Route by the shape of the raw QC output.
This is a mechanical routing check, not a policy judgment:

- If the raw QC output already contains explicit `POLICY.*` findings with file/line locations, that output is already the disposition artifact.
  Do not spawn a slop-report or disposition subagent to restate it.
  Proceed directly to **Route C: Remediation**.

- If the raw output does not contain explicit `POLICY.*` findings, use **Route B: Disposition**, then **Route C: Remediation** for any violations B returns.

- If you are unsure whether the output contains explicit policy-coded findings, do not decide.
  Use Route B.

A Semgrep, ast-grep, or central QC result whose message is `POLICY.RUNTIME_DEFAULT`, `POLICY.CRITICAL_DEPENDENCY`, `POLICY.NO_LEGACY_SHIM`, or another `POLICY.*` code is policy-coded output.
The policy violation report is already in front of you.

## Route B: Disposition Subagent

Use this route only when the raw output lacks explicit `POLICY.*` findings.

Spawn a subagent to determine policy-aligned dispositions.
The subagent must:

- Load the disposition policies explicitly: `policy-index` plus its references `red-flags.md`, `runtime-control-flow.md`, `policies.md`, and `test-proof-rules.md`; `anti-slop`; `reviewing-llm-code`; `bespoke-software-policy`; and `test-guidelines`. Do not give B the style-guide index; it belongs to C.

- Receive only the raw findings and file/line locations.
  Do not include the orchestrator's verdict, leaning, explanation, root-cause theory, or proposed fix.

- Determine for itself whether the raw output is a tool-execution failure, a tool finding, or cleared.
  The orchestrator does not pre-judge this split.

- Return dispositions only: `VIOLATION -> POLICY.*` or `CLEARED`, with quoted policy proof.
  A false-positive or detector-narrowing disposition carries formal policy-exception burden: policy code, justification, replacement invariant, boundary proof, and audit trail.

B is forbidden from proposing, sketching, or implying remediation, a correct shape, a patch, or a refactor.
If B proposes a fix, its output is contaminated and must be rerun.

## Route C: Remediation Subagent

Use this route for policy-coded QC output, or after Route B returns `VIOLATION -> POLICY.*` dispositions.

Spawn a separate remediation subagent.
The subagent must:

- Be a different agent from any disposition/review agent and from the orchestrator.

- Receive only the policy-coded findings: file/line, snippet when present in the raw QC output, and `POLICY.*` code.
  Do not include B's prose, root-cause narrative, suggested fix, or the orchestrator's opinion.

- Load the style-guide index: `style-guide/references/style-guide-index.md` (canonical home: `ai-review-ci` `skills/style-guide/references/style-guide-index.md`) and `fixing-slop`.

- For each `POLICY.*` code, follow the exact `REMEDIATE.*` route named by the canonical policy record.
  Do not restate or improvise the catalogue entry.

- Implement the remediation in the target repository only.

- Verify with the target repository's `just test-ci` gate unless the emitted directive names another policy-sensitive gate.

- Report the fix outcome and any blocker back to the orchestrator.

The orchestrator must not read the remediation policy during downstream triage.
C reads it.

## Escape Hatch: Genuine False Positives

This is the ONLY sanctioned route when a finding appears to be a true false positive — including the case where every catalog remediation would make honest code materially worse (obfuscated, golfed, needlessly indirect) solely to satisfy a detector.

The hatch is: **stop and explain to the user.** Present a formal policy-exception request containing the policy code, the justification, the replacement invariant that still protects the policy's intent, the boundary proof, and an audit trail.
Only the user grants the exception.

The hatch is NOT:

- contorting, golfing, or obfuscating the code until the detector goes quiet (that trades a lint warning for real damage and is itself slop);

- suppressing, scoping, or editing the check (`POLICY.NO_QC_SILENCING`);

- an agent — orchestrator, B, or C — declaring "false positive" and moving on.

If C, while remediating, concludes that every applicable `REMEDIATE.*` entry would degrade the code this way, C reports that conclusion back as a blocker with the draft exception request; the orchestrator forwards it to the user verbatim and waits.

## Dispatch Hygiene

Dispatch prompts are part of the proof boundary.
They must not seed the result.

For Route B, the dispatch may contain only:

- the raw, verbatim QC output or un-coded finding output;

- file/line locations from that output;

- the instruction to load the named disposition policies;

- the instruction to return dispositions only.

For Route C, the dispatch may contain only:

- policy-coded findings from the raw QC output or B's disposition list;

- file/line locations and snippets that came from the raw QC output;

- the instruction to load `style-guide/references/style-guide-index.md` and `fixing-slop`;

- the instruction to remediate according to the matching `REMEDIATE.*` entries.

Do not include:

- "suspected false positive," "confirmed slop," "probably a tool bug," or any similar orchestrator leaning;

- root-cause narratives not produced by the assigned role;

- suggested fixes from B or from the orchestrator;

- excerpts from the remediation policy copied by the orchestrator.

## Prohibited Behaviors

| Behavior | Why | Instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Orchestrator reads `~/ai-review-ci/` during downstream triage | Gives the failing-code producer gate internals it can game | Present raw output, route mechanically, then delegate |
| Orchestrator reads the remediation policy during downstream triage | That is C's job and contaminates routing | Tell C to load `style-guide/references/style-guide-index.md` |
| Spawning a slop-report subagent for already policy-coded QC output | Repeats the report and delays remediation | Treat the raw `POLICY.*` output as the disposition artifact and spawn C |
| Orchestrator forming/stating a finding disposition | The producer's self-judgment is inadmissible | Route without judgment |
| Seeding B or C with a verdict, leaning, or proposed fix | Collapses independent review/remediation into confirmation of the orchestrator | Dispatch raw findings or policy-coded dispositions only |
| B proposing remediation | Biases C toward B's preferred fix | B returns dispositions only |
| C receiving B's prose or suggested fix | Destroys C's independent derivation from the style-guide index | C gets only `VIOLATION -> POLICY.*` entries |
| Routing a `test-commit` or `test-push` failure through this protocol | Turns a directly repairable local error into multi-agent review ceremony | Fix the reported object directly and rerun the same local gate |
| Running isolated checks to verify CI remediation | Cherry-picks around the full acceptance gate | Run the target repo's `just test-ci` after remediation |
| Adding bypass comments or suppressions | Hides symptoms without satisfying policy | Fix the policy violation |
| Editing QC configs or thresholds during downstream triage | Weakens central QC for all consumers | Change only target project code |
| Continuing to advance the failing change after QC fails | The current output failed the gate | Pivot into triage first; resume once the gate is green |
| Halting all work, including unrelated tasks, on any QC failure | Overcompliance: the gate scopes to the failing change, not the session | Pause only the failing change; pivot your effort into triage |
| Golfing or obfuscating code purely to satisfy a detector | Trades a lint warning for real damage; the code is the product, not the gate | Use the Escape Hatch: stop and present a policy-exception request to the user |

## Evidence Requirements

Before reporting triage complete, these must be true:

- [ ] Raw QC output was presented to the user without filtering or interpretation.

- [ ] The active work unit authorized triage; any exception requiring new authority was presented to the user.

- [ ] The orchestrator did not inspect `~/ai-review-ci/` or the remediation policy during downstream triage.

- [ ] The routing decision was mechanical: explicit `POLICY.*` output went directly to C; un-coded output went to B first.

- [ ] If B ran, B returned dispositions only and no remediation.

- [ ] C received only policy-coded findings, loaded the style-guide index and `fixing-slop`, remediated from the matching `REMEDIATE.*` entries, and verified with the target repo's canonical QC command.

- [ ] B and C, when both are used, were different agents.
