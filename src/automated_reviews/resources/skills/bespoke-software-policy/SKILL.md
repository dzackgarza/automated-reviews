# Bespoke Software Policy

This repository targets the owner's actual machines with enforced conventions.
It is NOT distributed, multi-platform, or multi-user.
Apply these rules to EVERY finding before reporting.

**The goal is not "catch bugs."** Agents are clever adversaries.
They will not introduce code that crashes on the happy path.
The far more insidious residue is code that *silently fails* — it does not crash, it does not produce obviously wrong output, but it has disabled some safety guarantee, erased some diagnostic signal, or introduced a path where wrong behavior would be invisible.
That is the defect category this policy exists to catch.
The bridge-burning policies, [[anti-slop/SKILL|anti-slop]] red flags, and fail-loudly rule all exist for this reason.

An agent may frame silent-failure constructs as "speculative" or "enterprise."
They are not.
A safety guarantee that has been disabled is a concrete defect that exists right now, even if no crash has occurred.
The policy below makes this explicit.

**Fallback behavior is ALWAYS slop — zero exceptions, zero tolerance.**

Any construct whose primary effect is to accept data that does not match expectations and continue execution anyway is a 100/100 severity finding.
It must be flagged in review and must be triaged.
There are zero cases where a fallback is "justified," "allowed," "reasonable," "standard," "intentional," or acceptable under any other framing.
Linguistic gymnastics that condone fallback existence ("graceful degradation," "defensive programming," "belt and suspenders," "safety net") are themselves slop signals.

The remediation is ALWAYS the same: require the environment to be EXACTLY right.
Pass EXACTLY the right data.
Proceed EXACTLY along known, deterministic, enumerated cases.
Crash and burn IMMEDIATELY upon ANY deviation from these expectations.
This is highly intentional.
The code is MEANT to surface defects in the environment, the data, the configuration, and the dependencies.
Every error induces a new, EXPLICITLY handled branch in the code with a CLEAR audit trail of EXACTLY why it was introduced.

The agent MUST NOT make error-handling decisions FOR the user.
A fallback hides the error and substitutes the agent's guess about what to do.
The correct flow is: an error occurs → the program crashes → the user sees the error → the user decides what explicit logic to add, if any, to handle that specific error type.
Fallbacks short-circuit this flow and deprive the user of the information needed to make that decision.

## Foundational Principle: Crash at the Boundary

Every external boundary (SDK call, API response, config file, CLI input, database query result) is uncontrolled.
The shape of the data arriving at that boundary can change without notice.
Our code MUST:

- **Assert the expected shape forcefully and immediately** at the point of entry.
  This means runtime validation: a schema parse (Zod, Pydantic), a strict type guard that crashes on mismatch, or an assertion that halts execution if the data does not match expectations.

- **Fail loudly on mismatch.** The crash IS the feature.
  It is the automatic signal that the upstream contract changed.
  An agent monitoring crash logs or CI failures will see the stack trace, identify the boundary, and update the handler.
  This is orders of magnitude cheaper than debugging a silent wrong answer that propagated three modules downstream.

The following are BANNED at external boundaries:

- **`as any` or any type assertion** — silently accepts whatever comes in, disabling both compile-time and runtime checking.

- **Type-narrowing casts (`as ToolArgs`)** — a lie to the compiler.
  The cast does not check the actual runtime shape.
  If the upstream schema changes, the cast succeeds silently and wrong data flows through.

- **Schema validation that defaults or falls back** — `z.object({...}).passthrough()`, `parse()` with a fallback default, or any construct that accepts data that doesn't match the expected shape and tries to "make it work."
  See the [[policy-index/SKILL|policy-index]] bridge-burning policies.

**The correct pattern:** A runtime assertion that crashes on mismatch.

```
// CORRECT: crash at the boundary, schema change is audible
const args = ToolArgsSchema.parse(rawInput);

// CORRECT: Zod union that discriminates on a literal tag
const msg = MessageSchema.parse(raw);

// WRONG: silent type erasure
const args = rawInput as any;

// WRONG: lying to the compiler, no runtime check
const args = rawInput as ToolArgs;

// WRONG: accepting anything with a fallback
const args = ToolArgsSchema.passthrough().parse(rawInput);
```

This is not "being strict for its own sake."
This is the cheapest possible signal path: a schema change upstream → a crash at the boundary → an automated or agent-driven update to the handler.
The alternative is a schema change upstream → silent wrong data flows through → a user discovers the bug hours or days later → root-cause tracing through three modules.

**The OSOT implication:** The schema definition (Zod, Pydantic, or equivalent) IS the single source of truth for the expected shape.
The handler code reads from the parsed result.
If the schema changes, the handler code must change too — and the crash ensures that change cannot be ignored.

## Foundational Principle: Default to the Dependency

**The default is: use a mature dependency for the job.** The burden of proof is on the ABSENCE of a dependency, not its presence.
Dependency-dodging code (hand-rolling what a library already provides) must have a strong, explicit, auditable justification for remaining in the codebase — recorded as a comment at the site or in [[agent-memory/SKILL|agent-memory]].

**Bespoke tools are GLUE.** A "small tool" / "not a production service" / "259-line CLI utility" has almost NO need to reproduce any solved problem, ever.
Its entire reason for existing is to wire existing solutions together — calling APIs, transforming data, formatting output.
If you are spending lines on HTTP plumbing, argument parsing, config file reading, or JSON handling instead of using standard libraries, you are spending code on the part that already exists instead of the part that doesn't. That is backwards.

**Production services are the OPPOSITE case.** If you are building a service that serves thousands of requests, you MIGHT need to drop a library and own more low-level surface — because the library caused a concrete deficiency: wrong behavior, performance bottleneck, memory leak, dependency conflict.
That decision has a clear audit trail: the library was tried, the deficiency was observed, and the low-level replacement was introduced with documented reasoning.
This is the exception, not the default.

**Agents invert this distinction systematically.** An agent reads "259-line CLI tool, not a production service" and treats it as permission to REIMPLEMENT solved problems — because the agent's prior is that "adding a dependency increases complexity."
But a 259-line glue script is exactly the place you should NOT own low-level surface.
There is no production constraint that justifies it.
The code exists to wire things together, not to manufacture bespoke HTTP clients.
A production service is where you MIGHT justify dropping a library for control.
A glue script is where you NEVER should.

A human writing a tool for OpenRouter would: Google the problem, see 2-5 standard solutions using `httpx`, copy-paste the setup, and be done in 5 minutes.
Then spend the remaining 15 minutes on the actual bespoke logic (routing, prompt construction, output formatting) that justifies the tool's existence.
The agent's subprocess+curl approach takes 20 minutes to write AND leaves the code harder to read, harder to maintain, and harder to diagnose when it breaks.
The agent wasted its time AND produced an inferior result.

**Why this is not a style preference.** A human reading `subprocess.run(["curl", ...])` in a Python script or raw `fetch()` with 50 lines of error-handling plumbing in a Node.js script will immediately ask: *"why the fuck is this not using httpx / axios / the standard library?"* The bespoke code is a cognitive tax on every future reader.
The dependency is the *reduction* of cognitive load — it is the canonical solution that a human would reach for first.

**The default is inverted relative to agent priors.** Agents see "adding a dependency" as increasing complexity (another package to install, another version to track).
This is backwards.
The bespoke replacement IS the complexity — more lines, more edge cases, more test burden, more bugs.
A mature dependency externalizes that surface to a team that maintains it full time.
The dependency is a *net subtraction* of owned surface.

**The following heuristics apply:**

- If a job is described by a noun that matches a standard library or a widely used package (HTTP client, JSON parser, argument parser, CSV writer, date library, template engine, schema validator), and the codebase does not use that library without documented reason: a finding exists.

- "I didn't want to add a dependency" is NOT a valid justification.
  The bespoke replacement that exists IS the complexity you were trying to avoid.
  You already paid the cost — you got the inferior product.

- If the code is 100+ lines and a library does it in 5: the bespoke code needs to be deleted and replaced or justified.
  "It works" is not enough.
  It needs to solve a problem the library cannot (exact performance constraint, dependency-free delivery artifact, etc.) — and that justification must be written at the site.

- `subprocess.run(["curl", ...])` in Python is an automatic finding: the standard library has `urllib.request` and the ecosystem has `httpx`/ `requests`. Shelling out to curl loses structured error handling, typed exceptions, timeout control, streaming support, and integration with the Python exception chain.
  Every error from curl arrives as human-readable stderr text instead of a catchable exception.
  This is a diagnostic signal loss — a concrete trustworthiness defect.

- `subprocess.run` for running OTHER programs (ffmpeg, git, docker, a compiler, a headless browser) is fine — those are not jobs a Python library does.
  The finding is about using subprocess to REIMPLEMENT what a library already provides in-language.

- Node.js raw `fetch()` for a single simple call is fine.
  `fetch()` IS the standard library.
  The finding would be hand-rolling retry logic, response validation, or request signing that `axios` or `ky` provides out of the box.

**The Exception:** A dependency must be absent if it cannot be provisioned in the target environment (e.g., an embedded system, a lambda with strict size limits, an air-gapped machine).
This must be documented at the site with the specific constraint.
"Might be hard to install" is not a constraint — `uv add` or `npm install` is one command.

## Foundational Principle: No Downstream Users Means No Timid Work

The inverted-prior error above has a work-scoping twin.
Agents read "bespoke, owner-local" as "be careful because policy exists" and produce timid slices: partial fixes, deferred features, compatibility shims, sequential "safe" PRs, planning shells.
All of it protects downstream users who **do not exist**. There are no legacy consumers, no external callers, no users to break.
"Bespoke" means *move aggressively*: break internal APIs freely, delete broken structure instead of adapting around it, and take the subsystem rewrite when it is simpler than preserving what's there — because measured in total system cost, it usually is.

Constantly ask: **am I introducing timid, unambitious, or partial work as a means of "protecting" users who do not exist?** A small safe slice of a larger defect is not caution — it is a compatibility shim at the work-unit level, and it leaves the owner's tool in a mixed half-fixed state that generates new issues.
The same test as every other finding applies: does this restraint help the owner on their actual machine right now?
Restraint that only protects hypothetical consumers fails the Verification Rule.

Work-unit sizing, PR scope floors, and the direct-to-main path are owned by [[pr-scoping/SKILL|pr-scoping]]; load it before scoping any PR or triaging a backlog.

## Foundational Principle: Every Line Must Be Proven

Every piece of checked-in code must prove it is correct.
"Prove" does not mean "unit test" — proof can take many forms depending on complexity, but it must exist.
Unproven code is a concrete defect: the owner cannot trust its output on any non-happy-path input, and in an agent-generated codebase, the probability that code silently fails, does the wrong thing, operates on hallucinated data shapes, or was written based on incomplete understanding of its inputs is extremely high.
Proof is the only mitigation.

**The proof hierarchy (prefer earlier methods):**

1. **Assertions and stringent typing** — The simplest and most reliable proof.
   Peppering a script with type assertions, runtime guards, `assert` statements on data shapes, and `isinstance`/`instanceof` checks means that the fact the script runs AT ALL is itself a witness that the assertions passed.
   A script with a `assert isinstance(result, dict) and "status" in result` before every critical operation proves, on every execution, that its data looks correct.
   This is zero marginal cost above writing the code itself.

2. **Schema validation at boundaries** — Already covered by Crash at the Boundary.
   A Zod/Pydantic parse is a proof that the data matches expectations.
   A parse failure is a proof that it didn't.

3. **Property-based or value-range proofs** — `assert 0 <= x <= 1`, `assert len(results) > 0`, `assert all(isinstance(v, float) for v in values)`. These prove invariants without needing test infrastructure.

4. **Explicit test files with proof burdens** — For any logic with branching, conditionals, external dependencies, state machines, or data transformations.
   Every test must establish an a priori proof burden — what claim about the code's behavior is being established?
   — and then witness that claim with concrete inputs and expected outputs.

**When each level applies:**

- **Single scripts and modules in a file:** Levels 1-3 (assertions + type guards + schema validation) are sufficient.
  A script that runs without assertion failure has proven itself for that execution path.

- **Code with branching, conditionals, external calls, data transforms, or error handling:** At minimum Level 4 (explicit tests).
  If a function has an `if/else`, a `try/except`, a loop over external data, or a non-trivial transformation, its correctness cannot be proven by a single execution path — it needs tests that exercise each branch.

- **Agent-generated code of any significant size:** Level 4 is mandatory.
  Agent code has an extremely high probability of being half-baked, written based on guessed or incomplete data shapes, or referencing tools and types that do not exist.
  Tests are the only way to verify the agent's assumptions about the code's inputs and behavior.

**Defenses that are NOT valid:**

- "This is a single-user development tool" — The owner is the one who pays the cost of silent failure.
  The owner benefits MOST from proof, because there is no external user base to catch errors.

- "This is not a multi-consumer library" — Correctness is not about consumer count.
  It is about trust in the output.

- "No regression has occurred" — Tests prove correctness, not catch regressions.
  The absence of a regression is not evidence of correctness.

- "Tests are an enterprise pattern" — Tests are basic code hygiene, on the same level as type checking and syntax validation.
  Every language has a test framework.
  Write tests or write assertions.

- "Agent-generated code is obviously correct because the agent meant it to be" — This is the slop hypothesis.
  The agent's confidence is not evidence.
  Proof is evidence.

**The Verification Rule interaction:** "Does the absence of proof cause a concrete problem for the owner RIGHT NOW?" Yes — the owner cannot trust the output of the code.
Trust is only established by proof, not by the absence of observed failure.

Report these even if no crash or wrong output has been observed:

### Compiler / Type-Checker Evasion

- **Type-erasure at API/SDK/module boundaries** — `as any`, `as unknown as T`, or any type assertion that discards the contract between caller and callee.
  The fact that no schema has drifted yet is irrelevant: the compiler was disabled at this boundary, and every call through it is unchecked.

- **`// @ts-ignore`, `// @ts-expect-error` without justification**, double casts, `any` function parameters on public signatures, `!` non-null assertions on values whose nullability is not proven by an immediately preceding guard.

- **Generic misuse that erases safety** — `as any` in a generic function that could have used a proper type parameter; casting a generic return type to a narrower type without a runtime check.

### Runtime Safety Evasion

- **Fallback behavior is ALWAYS wrong — zero exceptions, zero tolerance.** Including: `try/except` of any kind (even `except ImportError:`), `try: import x` / conditional import patterns, `except:` / `except Exception:` to catch and continue, substituting a default value for missing configuration, catching an error to call a different implementation, or any construct whose primary effect is to accept data that does not match expectations and continue execution.
  The hard rules are explicit: *"Do not try import.
  Do not conditionally import.
  Do not catch ImportError and substitute a stub."* The dependency must be declared.
  Absent means crash at startup with a clear traceback.

- **`2>/dev/null` is ALWAYS wrong, period.** If stderr has no diagnostic data, suppressing it does nothing — it is unnecessary.
  If stderr has diagnostic data, suppressing it discards evidence of a problem.
  There is no case where `2>/dev/null` is correct.
  The same applies to any construct that discards or redirects diagnostic output.

### Diagnostic Signal Suppression

- **Assertions that test the wrong thing** — assertions that would pass on a broken implementation, smoke tests in proof paths, helper-level assertions substituted for boundary-level proof.
  See [[test-guidelines/SKILL|test-guidelines]].

- **Mocks in proof paths** — substituting a simulated component for a real one in a test that is supposed to prove correctness.
  Mocks prove nothing.
  See `policy-index/references/red-flags.md`.

- **Deletion without burden transfer** — deleting dead code, quarantined paths, or legacy branches without adding an assertion or invariant that would warn if the deletion was wrong.
  See [[fixing-slop/SKILL|fixing-slop]].

### Actual Bugs, Build Failures, Broken Workflows

- These are also in scope but are not the primary target — they are the *shadow* of the trustworthiness defect that caused them.

## Out of Scope (Suppress Immediately)

The following are NEVER valid findings in bespoke software.
If a finding matches any of these, suppress it without reporting:

### Portability

- Hardcoded `/home/dzack/` paths or any absolute local paths.
  Directory structure is enforced across the owner's machines.
  These are intentional.

- Machine-specific config files (local agent-tool configs, local editor configs, personal tool configs).
  They are machine-specific by design.

- Non-portable conventions, shell aliases, or tool choices.
  Portability across machines is not a goal.

- Version ranges that look "too narrow."
  The convention is latest unless pinning is strictly required.
  `requires-python = ">=3.14"` is correct.

### Enterprise Patterns

- Missing multi-platform support, scaling features, containerization, horizontal scaling, or cloud-native patterns.

- Missing security hardening, RBAC, audit logging, or compliance features.

- Missing CI/CD for multiple architectures or operating systems.

**Clarification: Dependency choices are NOT enterprise patterns.** A finding about `subprocess.run(["curl", ...])` instead of `httpx` is not about "scaling" or "productionization."
It is about basic code hygiene: using the right tool for the job, minimizing owned surface, and preserving structured diagnostics.
This holds for any file size — a 30-line script that shells out to curl instead of using `http.client` is still a valid finding.
"It's a small tool" is not a defense against reimplementing what a library provides.

### Backward Compatibility

- Breaking changes.
  There are no legacy consumers.
  Every change is breaking by default.
  Do not report interface changes, removals, or renames as compatibility defects.

- Deprecation warnings from updating to latest libraries.
  The fix is to adapt to the new API, not to pin the old version.

### Meta / Infrastructure

- The agent's own configuration (AGENTS.md, .agents/, skills/, prompts/). If it had a concrete defect, the user would see task failures.

- CI pipeline files (.github/workflows/, ~/ai-review-ci/). The mechanism is not the target.

- Stale backup files, temporary markers, throwaway comments.
  Housekeeping is Tier 2 at most and only reported when no significant issues exist.

### Speculative / Unverifiable Claims

- "This might cause issues in the future" without a specific observable mechanism.
  Every finding must identify a concrete defect that exists NOW.

- "Context dilution" or "cognitive overload" for the agent's own prompt length.
  The agent cannot test this claim.

- "A future contributor might be confused" — there are no future unknown contributors.
  The only audience is the owner.

### NOT Excluded: Type-Erasure and Compiler-Evasion Constructs

These are NOT in any Out of Scope category.
Do NOT suppress them:

- **`as any` / type assertions that erase type information at API boundaries.** The "SDK is loosely typed by design" defense does not exclude these.
  The handler code knows the concrete shape of its data.
  `as any` throws away all downstream type checking, meaning TypeScript cannot catch argument mismatches between a tool's declared schema and the handler's actual usage.
  This contradicts the system's "fail loudly" rule (silence is a bug) — it converts a compile-time error into a silent runtime failure (wrong behavior or crash).

  **Why it passes the Verification Rule:** The concrete problem exists NOW: the compiler is disabled from catching mismatches at this boundary.
  This is not speculation about a *particular* future schema drift — it is the *observation that the compiler's safety net is absent at a critical boundary*, which is itself a defect.
  Every call through this boundary is type-unchecked.

  **Correct pattern:** A runtime assertion that crashes on mismatch.
  Use a schema validator (Zod, Pydantic, etc.) or a strict type guard at the boundary — not a cast, not a "type-narrowing assertion."
  See the "Crash at the Boundary" principle above.

- **Type-guard bypasses, double casts (`x as unknown as T`), `// @ts-ignore`, `// @ts-expect-error`, and any construct whose sole effect is suppressing the type checker.** These are validation-evasion constructs, the opposite of "fail loudly."

- **`any` function parameters, silent `catch` clauses (`catch {}`), and `!` non-null assertions on values whose nullability is not proven by an immediately preceding guard.** These erase or evade safety guarantees that exist for a reason.

- **Runtime-suppression patterns like `try { ... } catch { /* ignore */ }` or `2>/dev/null` without an explicit reason.** See the [[policy-index/SKILL|policy-index]] bridge-burning policies and `policy-index/references/red-flags.md`.

### Comments Are Laundering (Treat Adversarially)

A rationalizing comment on policy-violating code is almost always a laundering attempt.
The agent would not have written the comment unless it KNEW the code was wrong — the comment exists precisely to protect the violation from review by signaling "this was intentional, don't flag it."

**Treat comments adversarially:** A comment on violating code is not evidence of justification.
It is evidence OF the violation.
The comment IS the red flag that should trigger heightened scrutiny, not a defense to be weighed.
An agent that writes `catch {}` with a comment about "session may be gone" could have written discriminated error handling instead — it chose not to, and then wrote the comment to insulate that choice from review.

**The laundering pattern:**

1. Agent writes code that violates a policy rule (`catch {}`, `as any`, `subprocess.run(["curl"])`, fallback default).

2. Agent adds a comment rationalizing the violation ("session may be gone", "SDK is loosely typed", "small tool, not production").

3. The comment acts as a signal to future agents and reviewers: "this was intentional, don't flag it."

4. Future agents see the comment and suppress the finding — the laundering succeeded.

**The rule:** A rationalizing comment on violating code is NEVER a defense.
It is a directive to fix the code.
There are no exceptions.

### Common Misinterpretation: The "Slop Pass" Error

Agents frequently misuse bespoke-software-policy to suppress valid findings by falsely categorizing them as speculative/enterprise.
Five common patterns:

**Pattern 1: Type-erasure slop pass.**

1. A concrete type-safety defect is flagged (`as any`, `// @ts-ignore`, double cast).

2. The agent invokes bespoke-software-policy as a blanket suppression tool, claiming "the SDK is loosely typed by design" or "this is a thin adapter."

3. This is WRONG. The policy only excludes the specific categories listed above.
   `as any` at a handler boundary is not in any excluded category.

**Pattern 2: Dependency-dodging slop pass.**

1. Bespoke code is flagged for reimplementing what a library provides (e.g., `subprocess.run(["curl", ...])` instead of `httpx`).

2. The agent invokes bespoke-software-policy, claiming "this is a small tool, not a production service; subprocess is adequate for this scope" or "this is a 259-line CLI tool, adding a dependency is unnecessary overhead."

3. This is WRONG. The "Default to the Dependency" principle above makes the burden of proof the opposite: the bespoke code needs justification to EXIST. Size is not a defense — a 30-line script that shells out to curl instead of using `http.client` is still a valid finding.
   The bespoke replacement IS the complexity the agent thinks it's avoiding.

**Pattern 3: Silent-error slop pass (comment laundering).**

1. A `catch {}` or other error-swallowing construct is flagged.

2. The agent points to a comment rationalizing the swallow ("session may be gone", "expected race condition", "noisy on shutdown").

3. This is WRONG. The comment is not a defense — it is evidence of laundering.
   The agent wrote the comment because it KNEW the code was wrong.
   The correct fix is discriminated error handling, not a rationalizing comment.
   See "Comments Are Laundering" above.

**Pattern 4: Missing-proof slop pass.**

1. Code with no assertions, no tests, and no correctness proof is flagged (e.g., 359-line config tool with zero tests).

2. The agent invokes bespoke-software-policy, claiming "this is a single-user tool on a development system, not a multi-consumer library; test absence is not a regression."

3. This is WRONG. The "Every Line Must Be Proven" principle makes proof mandatory for all checked-in code.
   "Single-user" is not an exclusion category — it is the OPPOSITE: the owner has no external user base to catch errors, so proof is MORE important.
   The absence of proof is the concrete defect; the owner cannot trust the output.
   Tests, assertions, and schema validation are the only remedies.

**Pattern 5: Fallback slop pass.**

1. A `try/except` around an import, a bare `except`, a fallback default, or any construct that accepts data not matching expectations is flagged.

2. The agent invokes bespoke-software-policy, claiming "the fallback path provides equivalent functionality" or "the try/except-first pattern is intentional for graceful local-import fallback."

3. This is WRONG. Fallback behavior is ALWAYS slop, zero exceptions.
   Even `except ImportError:` is wrong — the dependency must be declared and absent means crash.
   "Graceful fallback" is prohibited by both the Crash at the Boundary principle and the Runtime Safety Evasion section.
   The only acceptable remediation is to remove the try/except entirely and let the crash surface the absent dependency to the user.

**Litmus test for slop-pass invocations:** If the defense requires you to pretend a type-erasure construct is "speculative" (when it disables the compiler right now), "enterprise" (when it contradicts the fail-loudly rule), "proportional for a small tool" (when the bespoke code IS the complexity), "justified by a comment" (when the comment is laundering evidence), "single-user / no regression" (when every line must be proven), or a "graceful fallback" (when fallbacks are always slop), the defense is misaligned.
Report the finding.

Another agent might try to misread this section as "ah, so I should flag every `as any` anywhere in the codebase."
No. `as any` in test data construction or internal implementation details (where the erased type is immediately narrowed, or where a polymorphic generic truly cannot express the constraint) is fine.
The red flag is `as any` at **module/SDK/API boundaries** where it erases the contract between caller and callee, or at **critical runtime paths** where a type mismatch would cause silent wrong behavior.
Use judgment, not cargo-cult flagging.

## Proportionality: Earned vs. Manufactured Complexity

Complexity is not itself evidence of slop, and "complexity = bad" is the same error running in reverse — replacing judgment with a crude heuristic.
Some problems are genuinely hard (mathematical proof, statistical inference, provenance tracking, distributed systems), and **agent workflows legitimately need guardrails** against real failure modes: hallucinated data, provenance loss, draft/published confusion, stale context, source laundering, and review bypasses.
This very system is intentionally complex bespoke software; do not flag its real guardrails as slop.

The question is never "is this simple or complex?"
It is:

> Is this the simplest **standard** mechanism that adequately addresses a **demonstrated** failure mode?

**Earned complexity** is forced by a real constraint outside the agent's own explanatory system.
It has observable pressure behind it (a real incident, scale, domain, legal, or reproducibility constraint), can explain why the standard alternative is insufficient *in this case*, remains locally testable without learning a private cosmology, and is subordinate to the payload.
A long proof, a real schema-validation layer, an artifact-boundary check, a source-required claim record, or an adversarial review pass are controls, not slop.

**Manufactured complexity** is generated by the agent's need to organize, justify, or preserve its own thoughts.
Its tell is **ordering**: categories precede instances, policy precedes users, governance precedes payload, terms precede referents, roles precede people, threat models precede observed threats, correction machinery precedes actual corrections, internal identifiers precede any real retrieval need.
It is justified mainly by internal documents, given grandiose private names, larger than the work it governs, and resistant to deletion.
This is `O5 Complexity Displacement` / `O6 Process–Payload Inversion` in the `llm-failure-modes/references/agent-distortion-index.md`.

Two symmetric failure modes to reject:

- **False positive:** flagging the owner's intentional bespoke complexity or a real agent-failure guardrail as slop because it is elaborate.
  Run the Design-Choice gate first; a deliberately coupled, narrowly-scoped, owner-requested mechanism is a design choice, not slop.

- **Slop pass:** accepting manufactured governance, classification, or doctrine machinery by calling it "intentional bespoke complexity."
  A control earns its place only against a demonstrated failure mode and only when it is the simplest standard mechanism for it.

The reconciliation question for any bespoke mechanism is comparative, not existential: not "why does this exist?"
(which accepts its frame) but "why this, when \[database / git / PR review / issues / ordinary access control / citations] already addresses the demonstrated failure?"
The bespoke mechanism carries the burden of proof for departing from standard practice.

## Verification Rule

For every potential finding, ask: "Does this cause a concrete problem for the owner RIGHT NOW on their actual machine?"
If no, suppress it.

For every proposed remedy, ask: "Does this make the software work better for the owner on their actual machine?"
If the remedy only helps an imagined future scenario, reject it.

## The Cost Model Is Not the Monorepo's

Agents arrive carrying a cost function learned from large shared codebases, and it is
wrong here in the direction that does the most damage.

In a shared trunk serving thousands of downstream consumers, a new dependency is a
supply-chain liability, a security surface, a version-conflict risk, and a maintenance
obligation across many teams. The narrowest change wins, the burden of proof sits on the
addition, and "does this earn its keep?" is the right question to ask of a library.

None of those costs exist here. There are no downstream consumers, no fleet, no review
queue, and no deployment surface of that kind. The scarce resource is the owner's
attention, and the dominant cost in the work is **re-entry**: paging a problem back into
a human head after the context has evaporated.

So the defaults invert, and both directions matter:

- **A dependency does not justify itself; hand-rolling does.** Asking whether a library,
  reference implementation, or standard pattern "earns its keep" has already reversed the
  policy before the analysis starts. Hand-rolled code is the liability — it is the thing
  that must be maintained, understood, and re-derived by whoever meets it next. The
  question is never whether to take the dependency; it is why anything is being written
  by hand.
- **Prefer the general solution when the marginal cost over the special case is small.**
  A narrow solution does not defer work, it defers *thinking*, and it deletes the record
  that thinking is owed. The problem is closed, the context is lost, and it returns weeks
  later wearing a different feature. The bill then is: reconstruct the landscape,
  excavate why the special case was chosen, decide whether its assumptions still hold,
  and generalize under pressure with less context than the first time. That is strictly
  more expensive than building the general form would have been, and it is charged again
  at every special case.
- **The compounding cost is that "done" stops meaning done.** Once a few closed problems
  have reopened, nothing marked complete can be trusted without re-checking, which is a
  tax on every future decision rather than on the one that was scoped narrowly.

**Survey before scoping.** "Minimal" is defined against requirements. If the goal
landscape was never surveyed, the solution is minimal against a guess, and the guess is
what gets discovered to be wrong later.

**This is not a licence for speculative abstraction.** The test is not "might this be
needed some day" but "is the general form understood, and is it not much harder?" When
the general form is unknown, go and find it — that is the same external-lookup obligation
[[known-solution-first/SKILL|known-solution-first]] carries. When it is known and cheap,
build it. When it is known and genuinely expensive, that is a real decision: record the
cost in the plan, not as a note about a thing not done.
