# TypeScript and Bun Style Profile

Load the relevant foundation card from the [[style-guide/references/style-guide-index|style-guide index]], then apply these constructions:

- Parse owned configuration and boundary input once with Zod schemas into total typed values before application logic runs.

- Model ordinary variants as discriminated unions and dispatch exhaustively with `switch` or an exhaustive match helper; do not let thrown failures select normal behavior.

- Keep unexpected failures visible.
  Translate a specific external failure at the owned boundary only into an explicit typed result/outcome.

- Do not use `any`, broad `unknown` escapes, stringly error channels, optional core state, or boolean mode flags where the domain has named variants.

- Prove behavior through the real TypeScript/Bun boundary with semantic assertions and real project fixtures; mocks do not discharge boundary proof.
