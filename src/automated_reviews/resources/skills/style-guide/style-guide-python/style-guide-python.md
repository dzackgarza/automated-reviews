# Python Style Profile

Load the relevant foundation card from the [[style-guide/references/style-guide-index|style-guide index]], then apply these constructions:

- Validate owned configuration and boundary input once with Pydantic models or explicit dataclasses; construct total validated state before application logic runs.

- Represent ordinary variants with enums, dataclasses, or discriminated Pydantic models; use exhaustive `match` over domain states rather than exception-selected flow.

- Keep unexpected failures visible.
  Translate one specific external exception at the owned boundary only into a typed domain outcome.

- Use explicit type annotations and structured exceptions/results.
  Do not use `Any`, broad dictionaries, `hasattr`, or sentinel values to evade the model.

- Prove behavior through the real Python boundary with project-owned fixtures and semantic assertions; do not replace it with mocks or helper-only proof.
