# Non-Proof / Administrative Artifacts

## Bad pattern: Test-shaped artifacts that prove nothing (smoke tests, coverage-only tests, import tests, constructor tests), quarantine labels that launder slop ("smoke", "non-proof", "diagnostic-only", "legacy"), and administrative records (issues, comments, docs) presented as completion of an implementation or proof obligation.

All three patterns share the same root: an artifact that looks like evidence but carries no proof weight, creating a surface future agents can cite as "already handled."

## Preferred construction: For each artifact, determine whether it carries a real proof burden:

- Remove test-shaped artifacts that add no proof (they will be cited later as evidence of a real test suite).

- Move non-proof diagnostics to a non-QC diagnostic surface (separate tool, separate command, separate directory, not in the test suite).

- Require burden disposition for quarantine labels — either the artifact is real proof or it is removed.

- Administrative records (issues, comments, docs) document what remains to be done; they do not close the obligation.

## Use this pattern when:

- The test file uses "smoke", "non-proof", "diagnostic-only", or similar disclaimers.

- The test asserts nothing about the source-of-truth boundary (imports, constructor, status labels).

- An issue, PR comment, or doc change is presented as completion of a code/proof task.

## Choose a different pattern when:

- The diagnostic surface is explicitly maintained for debugging and never cited in QC or reviews.

- The administrative record genuinely closes the task (e.g., a research decision documented in an issue is the completion).
