# Bash Style Profile

Load the relevant foundation card from the [[style-guide/references/style-guide-index|style-guide index]], then apply these constructions:

- Start owned scripts with `set -euo pipefail`; validate required arguments, environment variables, files, and commands once at the boundary before work begins.

- Make operation modes explicit with subcommands or `case` over declared values.
  Do not infer modes from failed commands, missing files, or ambient shell state.

- Let unexpected command failures stop the script.
  Handle only a known, expected command status with an explicit branch and a stated domain meaning.

- Keep configuration in tracked files or explicit arguments.
  Do not silently default, discover, or continue after a missing critical dependency.

- Prove the real command path with controlled fixtures and observable outputs or side effects; do not use a no-crash check as proof.
