"""Reviewer-signal eval metrics (#41, was #28).

Scores a candidate reviewer-prompt structure against the disposition-stamped
ground truth extracted from a real PR review loop (see
tool-artifacts/scripts/extract_reviewer_eval.py). The dataset labels every
review thread with the owner's disposition:

- ``accepted``: a real finding the reviewer should emit;
- ``rejected``: off-target or policy-misaligned churn the reviewer should
  never have emitted;
- ``outdated`` / ``duplicate`` / ``unstamped``: not scoreable — superseded by
  code motion, folded into a canonical thread, or resolved without a verdict.

A candidate is evaluated by the set of ground-truth findings it re-emits:
precision over the scoreable threads it touched (how much of its output is
real rather than churn) and recall of the accepted findings (how much real
signal it keeps). The #41 target is a prompt that raises precision without
dropping recall.
