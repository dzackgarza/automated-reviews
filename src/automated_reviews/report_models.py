"""Pydantic report models — the single validation spec for review reports.

The model selected by ``report_type`` ("slop") defines the
report contract: field semantics, semantic rejection rules, and the
hallucination checks (every cited path must exist in the reviewed checkout,
every line range must lie within the file). The reviewed checkout is the
process CWD when validation runs.

``schema_version`` and ``report_type`` are tool-owned identification fields:
``validate-report`` stamps them before validation when the candidate omits
them, and the ``Literal`` types reject any mismatching agent-supplied value.

Finding identity is also defined here: ``finding_fingerprint`` keys SARIF
alerts and PR review threads to the same tracked item across runs.
