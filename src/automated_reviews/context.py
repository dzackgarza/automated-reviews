"""Generate a compact reviewer context file from code scanning alert state.

This context is given to review agents before they run. It suppresses duplicate
report prose; open alerts are carried forward mechanically by SARIF conversion.

Queries code scanning alerts for the relevant SARIF tool names
(ai-review/slop) and formats them by state
(open, dismissed, fixed). The alerts API filters by tool.driver.name,
NOT by the upload-sarif category.

The output is a markdown file with open/dismissed/fixed findings grouped
by state. Pass it to the review agent as instructions:

  "Open alerts are carried forward by automation. Do not duplicate them in your
  report unless you have new evidence, the problem reappears in a materially
  different form, or the previous resolution is directly contradicted by the
  current code."
