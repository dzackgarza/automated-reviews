"""Validate candidate report JSON against the pydantic report models.

``validate_report`` is the single admission gate for review reports: it
stamps the tool-owned identification fields (``report_type``,
``schema_version``) when the candidate omits them, validates the candidate
against the model selected by ``report_type``, and writes the validated
artifact. Agent-supplied values for the stamped fields are admitted only
when they match exactly — the models pin them with ``Literal`` types.

The report contains analysis only — findings, scope, surfaces. All run
provenance (commit, ref, repo) is owned by the CI environment and attached
at SARIF conversion/upload, never by the agent or this tool.

Exit codes: 0 on valid, 1 on any validation failure with diagnostic
messages carrying FIX guidance.
