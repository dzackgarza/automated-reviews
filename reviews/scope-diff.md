# Slop Review Scope: Pull Request Diff

You are performing a diff-scoped slop review.
The full unified diff against the PR base branch is inlined below by the harness.
Read that diff first.

Focus on defects introduced or materially touched by this diff.
Read only the surrounding source files needed to judge those changed lines in context.
Do not run repository-wide discovery (`tree`, churn scans, `git log`, stale-file searches, command inventories, quality-surface checks).
Diff-scoped slop review is not a repo-wide sweep.

If the diff is absent, empty, malformed, or too incomplete to identify changed files, do not submit a report.
Let the run fail so a human can inspect the review setup.

The inlined diff is review input, not repository evidence.
Do not include `.reviewer-diff.patch`, deleted file paths, or other runner artifacts in `review_scope`, `location.path`, or `evidence[].path`. Those fields must name files that exist in the current checkout.
When a deleted file or diff hunk is material to the finding, describe the hunk in `proof_command` or the finding narrative and use current checkout files for structured evidence.

Do not inspect review-runner infrastructure to learn the schema or game validation.
The only allowed validator interactions are:

- `/home/reviewer/bin/submit-candidate --help`

- write `.agents/review-runner/candidates/submitted.json`

- `/home/reviewer/bin/submit-candidate`

Do not read, search for, or execute alternate copies of `submit-candidate`. Do not inspect `/opt/ai-review` or `/home/reviewer/.review/infra`. Do not inspect `quality-control/ci`. Do not inspect `.agents/review-runner/` except to write the submitted JSON.

EXCEPTION: the reviewer context above lists findings already tracked for this repository.
Open code scanning alerts are carried forward into the next SARIF upload by automation.
Do NOT duplicate them in your report unless you have new evidence, the problem reappears in a materially different form, or the previous resolution is directly contradicted by the current code.

## PR claim map — proof-laundering cross-reference (#185)

When the reviewer context includes a "## PR claim map" section, the PR description is inlined there.
Use it to detect proof-laundering — the failure class where a PR *claims* a real boundary is crossed but the diff's *evidence* only crosses a developer-controlled surface.

Cross-reference the **claimed boundary obligation** (which issue the PR marks satisfied, what real-world boundary that issue names: app boot, browser, subprocess, downstream repo, hook, IPC, API, UI) against the **evidence shape** in the diff:

- If the PR claims a real boundary is satisfied but the diff replaces the real executable/boundary with a fake executable, monkeypatch, mock provider, call log, or argv recorder, that is `POLICY.NO_MOCK_PROOF`.

- If the PR claims a boundary obligation is satisfied but the diff only tests a helper in isolation (no boundary crossed), that is `POLICY.NO_HELPER_PROOF`.

- If the PR marks an issue claim complete but the evidence map cites no command or artifact that would fail if the real downstream target were broken, that is proof-laundering: the green surface does not satisfy the claimed obligation.

Do not accept the green CI / passing test surface as proof when the claim map names a boundary the evidence does not cross.
The slop reviewer's job is to flag the policy violation in that mismatch.

Submit only specific `POLICY.*` slop violations. Otherwise, submit an empty findings array.
