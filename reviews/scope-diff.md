# Review Scope: Pull Request Diff

You are reviewing a pull request.
The full unified diff against the PR base branch is inlined below by the harness.
Read that diff first.

Focus on defects introduced or materially touched by this diff.
Read only the surrounding source files needed to judge those changed lines in context.
Do not run repository-wide discovery (`tree`, churn scans, `git log`, stale-file searches, command inventories, quality-surface checks).
PR review is not a repo-wide sweep.

If the diff is absent, empty, malformed, or too incomplete to identify changed files, do not submit a report.
Let the run fail so a human can inspect the review setup.

The inlined diff is review input, not repository evidence.
Do not include `.reviewer-diff.patch`, deleted file paths, or other runner artifacts in `review_scope`, `location.path`, or `evidence[].path`. Those fields must name files that exist in the current checkout.
When a deleted file or diff hunk is material to the finding, describe the hunk in `proof_command` or the finding narrative and use current checkout files for structured evidence.

Do not inspect review-runner infrastructure to learn the schema or game validation.
The only allowed validator interactions are:

- `/home/reviewer/bin/submit-candidate --help`

- write `.agents/review-runner/candidates/submitted.json`

- `/home/reviewer/bin/submit-candidate`

Do not read, search for, or execute alternate copies of `submit-candidate`. Do not inspect `/opt/ai-review` or `/home/reviewer/.review/infra`. Do not inspect `quality-control/ci`. Do not inspect `.agents/review-runner/` except to write the submitted JSON.

EXCEPTION: the reviewer context above lists findings already tracked for this repository.
Open code scanning alerts are carried forward into the next SARIF upload by automation.
Do NOT duplicate them in your report unless you have new evidence, the problem reappears in a materially different form, or the previous resolution is directly contradicted by the current code.

## PR claim map — proof-laundering cross-reference (#185)

When the reviewer context includes a "## PR claim map" section, the PR description is inlined there.
Use it to detect proof-laundering — the failure class where a PR *claims* a real boundary is crossed but the diff's *evidence* only crosses a developer-controlled surface.

Cross-reference the **claimed boundary obligation** (which issue the PR marks satisfied, what real-world boundary that issue names: app boot, browser, subprocess, downstream repo, hook, IPC, API, UI) against the **evidence shape** in the diff:

- If the PR claims a real boundary is satisfied but the diff replaces the real executable/boundary with a fake executable, monkeypatch, mock provider, call log, or argv recorder, that is `POLICY.NO_MOCK_PROOF`.

- If the PR claims a boundary obligation is satisfied but the diff only tests a helper in isolation (no boundary crossed), that is `POLICY.NO_HELPER_PROOF`.

- If the PR marks an issue claim complete but the evidence map cites no command or artifact that would fail if the real downstream target were broken, that is proof-laundering: the green surface does not satisfy the claimed obligation.

Do not accept the green CI / passing test surface as proof when the claim map names a boundary the evidence does not cross.
The reviewer's job is to flag the mismatch between the *stated obligation* and the *evidence shape*, not to ratify the appearance of progress.

## Original issue asks — coverage cross-reference (#242, #246)

When the reviewer context includes an "## Original issue asks" section, the verbatim bodies of the issues GitHub will close when this PR merges are inlined there.
The set is GitHub-computed (`closingIssuesReferences` — closing keywords and manual issue links alike), so it is exactly the closure side-effect the merge will trigger, independent of how the PR body words it.
Those texts are the authoritative completion contract; the PR description is the author's untrusted paraphrase of them, and agents systematically narrow the ask when restating it.

For every issue in that section, enumerate the asks in the issue's own text and classify each against the diff: done (cite the evidence), partial, untouched, or contradicted.
Do not accept the PR body's characterization of scope as a substitute for this comparison.
Quantifiers in the issue keep their meaning: "all", "each of the sites", "every" cannot be narrowed to the subset the PR touched — a subset is partial, not done.
A change that makes a named defect stop being exercised (the defective path goes vacuous, a consumer degenerates silently) is not a fix for that ask; classify it as untouched or contradicted, not done.

If any ask is untouched or partial, that is a 🔴 Under-scoped Work Unit (the work-unit gate's Critical finding): the merge itself is the defect.
The only remedies are completing the remaining asks in this PR, or an evidence-backed falsification of the ask against the issue's own acceptance standard.
Do not prescribe relabeling the closure claim — demoting `Closes` to `Refs`, unlinking the issue, "partial" notes, scope caveats — as a path to merge.
A PR opens only because it claimed a full work unit; relabeling incomplete work so it can merge honestly-labeled is completion-laundering, and prescribing it is itself a review defect.
