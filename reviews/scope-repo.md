# Review Scope: Repository-Wide Sweep

You are performing a FRESH, COMPREHENSIVE REPOSITORY AUDIT. Scan the ENTIRE repository source tree — do NOT limit analysis to recent commits or diffs.
Analyze all files as if this were a day-zero audit of a new codebase.

Coverage strategy:

1. Run `tree -L 3` to understand the directory layout.

2. Identify hotspots: most-churned files, oldest untouched files, recently modified files.

3. Read key configs, docs, and justfile commands.

4. Read source code from high-churn and old files.

EXCEPTION: the reviewer context above lists findings already tracked for this repository.
Open code scanning alerts are carried forward into the next SARIF upload by automation.
Do NOT duplicate them in your report unless you have new evidence, the problem reappears in a materially different form, or the previous resolution is directly contradicted by the current code.
