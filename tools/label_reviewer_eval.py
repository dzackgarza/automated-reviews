"""Label reviewer-eval threads by having the CI model read the dispositions (#41).

Disposition stamps are intelligent free text written by reviewers and triage
agents — not automated-check output. Parsing them with keyword regexes both
mislabels threads (negations, casing, embedded quotes) and pressures authors
toward box-checking templates. This script instead sends each thread's reply
comments to the active model in the review metadata and
asks it to judge what the owner ultimately decided.

    uv run --project . tools/label_reviewer_eval.py raw.json labeled.json

Threads with no replies are labeled ``unstamped`` directly — there is nothing
to read. Every model answer is validated against the id set and label enum;
a batch that fails validation is retried thread-by-thread, and any thread
that still fails aborts the run loudly.

comments that followed a review finding (the finding itself is omitted). The repository \
owner (or their triage agent) expressed a decision about the finding somewhere in these \
replies, in ordinary prose — there is no required format.

For each thread, judge what the owner ULTIMATELY decided:
- accepted: the finding was acknowledged as real/actionable (even if remediation was deferred)
- rejected: the finding was turned down as wrong, out of scope, or policy-misaligned
- outdated: the finding no longer applied because the code had moved on / was superseded
- duplicate: the thread was closed as a duplicate of a canonical thread
- needs-investigation: the owner explicitly deferred judgment pending investigation
- unstamped: no decision is expressed in the replies

Read the prose for its meaning; negations like "why NOT accepted" are not acceptances. \
The latest decision wins if earlier replies disagree.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object mapping each thread id (as a string) to one label, \
no other text. Example: {"123": "rejected", "456": "duplicate"}
